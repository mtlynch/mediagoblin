About the Site Administrator's Guide
====================================

This is the site administrator manual for GNU MediaGoblin.  It covers
how to set up and configure MediaGoblin and the kind of information
that someone running MediaGoblin would need to know.

We have other documentation at:

* http://mediagoblin.org/join/ for general "join us" information
* http://wiki.mediagoblin.org/ for our contributor/developer-focused wiki
