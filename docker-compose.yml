# A docker-compose recipe for MediaGoblin hacking.
#
# Tested on Trisquel 8 and Guix System. Currently runs Python 3 and works for
# images, audio and video.
#
# To run the system:
#
#   docker-compose up  # or
#   docker-compose up --build  # to build the images
#
# To get a shell or Python interpreter inside a temporary container:
#
#   docker-compose run --rm web /bin/bash
#   docker-compose run --rm web /opt/mediagoblin/bin/python
